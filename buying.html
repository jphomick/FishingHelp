    <p>You probably think you need a fishing pole to fish. Well, yes and no. I've seen people catch fish with their bare hands, but let's not go in that.
    <br />You need a fishing pole.
    <br />You also need lures. That's where I come in.</p>

    <h1>Shad</h1>
    <p>The shad is your basic lure. It's a crankbait. You throw it in the water, reel it back in, and keep that up until you catch a fish.
    <br /> Some people get by with just these, but if you only fishing with one of these, you're missing out on half the fun.</p>

    <h1>Popper</h1>
    <p>This is a popper. Like a crankbait, you drop it into the water and reel it back...with one exciting difference.
    <br/>You <strong>POP</strong> it! Who would have guessed? Simply pull the lure towards your boat and the lure with wriggle with the excitement that fish just gravitate towards.</p>

    <h1>Worm</h1>
    <p>When you're ready for a change of pace, bring out the worm. This plastic power-play you drop to the bottom of the waters
    and brush up against the organic matter floating around down there. You want to brush past a fish that's just hanging out.</p>
